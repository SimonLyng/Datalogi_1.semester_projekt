        <p>The objective of the game is to guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player takes turns to guess a letter.</li>
            <li>If the suggested letter exists in the word, it will appear in all its correct positions.</li>
            <li>If the suggested letter does not exist in the word, one guess is subtracted.</li>
            <li>The game continues until the word is completely guessed or all guesses are used.</li>
